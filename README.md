### Application: Transaction Manager created as a technical exercise for Divvy.

### About:

I created this application with a MySQL database, a PHP backend, and a React frontend.

### Remote Installation:

I installed this application on my website: terimorgan.com/TransactionManager. I accomplished this by running npm run build and copying those files to my server where PHP was already enabled.
